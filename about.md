<p>Hey there! I'm Igor Tarasenko, a seasoned iOS developer with over 13 years of experience in the tech industry. Born in Ukraine and now based in Amsterdam, I've built a career that spans from startups to tech giants, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible in mobile development.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working at Uber, where I contribute to the main Uber iOS app. I also enjoy working on independent projects, creating innovative apps that leverage the power of AI and machine learning. One such project is Whisperboard, an opensource AI-powered iOS app that allows people to record their voice notes and then uses an on-device ML model to provide transcription and translation of their notes.</p>

<p>I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to every project. I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and technology, which informs my approach to creating intuitive, user-centric applications.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me mentoring aspiring developers on CodeMentor, exploring the latest in AI research, or spending quality time with my family. I'm on a mission to create apps that make a real difference in people's lives, all while striving for that perfect work-life balance.</p>
