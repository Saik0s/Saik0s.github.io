# Swift styling using extensions

One morning I was working on the new screen for the app and did notice that I have such a lot of elements on the screens that it is really hard to manage them in the way I usually do it. I decided to separate styles from screens source files. Luckily I was using Swift language and it has a very powerful mechanics called "extensions". 

Lets separate our UI styles to several groups and create files for each of them.
